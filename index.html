            <p>Nutrition plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and well-being. A balanced diet provides the essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients your body needs to function optimally. Incorporating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your meals can help boost energy levels, support immune function, and promote healthy weight management. Proper hydration is also vital, as water facilitates digestion, nutrient absorption, and toxin elimination.
