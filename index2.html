            <p>Mental health is a vital aspect of overall well-being, encompassing emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how individuals think, feel, and act, influencing their ability to handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions. Good mental health isn't merely the absence of mental illness; it also involves positive characteristics such as the ability to cope with life's challenges, build strong relationships, and recover from setbacks. Maintaining mental health requires self-care practices like regular exercise, adequate sleep, healthy eating, and mindfulness. Seeking professional help when needed is crucial, as early intervention can significantly improve outcomes and quality of life.
